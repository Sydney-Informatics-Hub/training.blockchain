teaching: 10
exercises: 15
questions:
- "How do I write my own cryptocurrency?"
objectives:
- "Write a cryptocurrency in Solidity"
- "Deploy the contract to the network"
keypoints:
- "A cryptocurrency is a contract"
- "Contract transactions are verified on the network"

This episode shows you how to write your own cryptocurrency contract using the Solidity programming language. We can then launch this coin/contract to the Etherum (or test) network.


# Writing your own cryptocurrency

Let's all become SIHCoin trillionaires! Visit https://remix.ethereum.org/ and we will start writing our contracts.

~~~
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

//Setup the contract with variables defined.
contract SIHCoin {    
    string name_;
    string symbol_;
    uint8 decimal_;
    uint256 totalsupply;
    
    constructor (string memory _name, string memory _symbol, uint8 _decimal, uint256 _totalsupply) public {
        name_ = _name;
        symbol_ = _symbol;
        decimal_ = _decimal;
        totalsupply = _totalsupply;
        balances[msg.sender] = totalsupply;
    }
    
    function name() public view returns (string memory){
        return name_;
    }
    
    function symbol() public view returns (string memory) {
        return symbol_;
    }
    
    function decimals() public view returns (uint8) {
        return decimal_;
    }    
    
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256){
        return totalsupply;   
    }
    
    mapping (address => uint256) balances;
    
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance) {
        return balances[_owner];
    }
    
    event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);
    
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success){
        
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _value, "Not enough balance!");
        
        //update balances
        balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
        balances[_to] += _value;
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
        
        return true;
    }

# MPI: Message Passing Interface
MPI is a standardized and portable message-passing system designed to function on a wide variety of parallel computers.
The standard defines the syntax and semantics of a core of library routines useful to a wide range of users writing portable message-passing programs in C, C++, and Fortran. There are several well-tested and efficient implementations of MPI, many of which are open-source or in the public domain.

MPI for Python, found in [mpi4py](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), provides bindings of the MPI standard for the Python programming language, allowing any Python program to exploit multiple processors. [This simple code](https://sydney-informatics-hub.github.io/training.artemis.python/files/mpi.py) demonstrates the collection of resources and how code is run on different processes:

~~~
#Run with:
#mpiexec -np 4 python mpi.py

from mpi4py import MPI

comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
size = comm.Get_size()
rank = comm.Get_rank()

print("I am rank %d in group of %d processes." % (rank, size))
~~~
{: .python}

If you want to submit this python script on Artemis, the PBS script is below. Notice here we are requesting 4 seperate nodes in the PBS script. This amount aligns with the ```-np 4``` flag (number of processes), so each process is seperate and executed on different nodes on Artemis.
~~~
#!/bin/bash

#PBS -P Training
#PBS -N testmpi
#PBS -l select=4:ncpus=1:mem=1GB
#PBS -l walltime=00:10:00
#PBS -q defaultQ

cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR
module load python
module load openmpi-gcc

mpiexec -np 4 python mpi.py > mpi.out
~~~
{:. bash}

Let's now get stuck into some more specific use-cases and tools to use.
