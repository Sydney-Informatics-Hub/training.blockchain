title: "Write your own Crypto"
teaching: 10
exercises: 15
questions:
- "How do I write my own cryptocurrency?"
objectives:
- "Write a cryptocurrency in Solidity"
- "Deploy the contract to the network"
keypoints:
- "A cryptocurrency is a contract"
- "Contract transactions are verified on the network"

This episode shows you how to write your own cryptocurrency contract using the Solidity programming language. We can then launch this coin/contract to the Etherum (or test) network.


# Writing your own cryptocurrency

Let's all become SIHCoin trillionaires! Visit [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and we will start writing our own smart-contracts and [ERC-20 tokens](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/).

Setup the contract with variables defined.
A Solidity contract type is a collection of code, functions, etc, that lives at an address on the blockchain

The Ethereum Virtual Machine or EVM is the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum. It is completely isolated, which means that code running inside the EVM has no access to network, filesystem or other processes.
