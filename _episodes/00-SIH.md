# The Sydney Informatics Hub

The Sydney Informatics Hub (SIH) is a _[Core Research Facility](https://sydney.edu.au/research/facilities.html)_ of the University of Sydney. Core Research Facilities centralise essential research equipment and services that would otherwise be too expensive or impractical for individual Faculties to purchase and maintain. The classic example might be the room-size electron-microscopes, built into specialised rooms in the Sydney Microscopy & Microanalysis unit.

**Artemis HPC** itself is a multi-million dollar set of equipment, a 'supercomputer', and is the main piece of equipment supported by SIH. However, we also provide a wide range of research services to aid investigators, such as:

* [Training and workshops](https://sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub/workshops-and-training.html)
* [Project consulting and assisstance](https://sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub/project-support.html) with Statistics, Data Science, Research Engineering, Bioinformatics, Modeling/Simulation/Visualisation.
* [Research data management](https://sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub/digital-research-infrastructure.html) consulting and platform support.

We also aim to cultivate a **data community** at USyd, organising monthly [Hacky Hours](https://sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub/workshops-and-training/hacky-hour.html), outside training events (eg NVIDIA, Pawsey Center), and data/coding-related events. Look out for everthing happening on our [calander](https://www.sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub/workshops-and-training/training-calendar.html) or contact us (at sih.info@sydney.edu.au) to get some digital collaboration going.
