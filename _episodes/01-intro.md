# Blockchain Ecosystem

The **blockchain** is the distributed immutable database that drives cryptocurrencies and smart contracts.
A series of transaction pools (blocks) connected by a hash pointer (chain).

Some key words that might come up:

* Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Hyperledger 
* Cryptocurrency
* Solidity
* Smart Contracts
* Truffle, Ganace, Metamask, etherum remix, web3.js, infura.
* Wallets, addresses, hashes

<br>

# Technology behind blockchain

* Public-key (asymmetric) cryptography 
* Hash functions
* Merkel Trees
* Zero Knowledge Proofs

# There are many blockchains

Bitcoin was the first. https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf

Satoshi Nakamoto: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto

Public or private (permissioned) or hybrid blockchains.

From the original blocks mined: 1,148,800 BTC has never been spent [(ref>)](https://bitslog.com/2013/04/17/the-well-deserved-fortune-of-satoshi-nakamoto/).

# Blockchain Explorer
Visit *the blockchain* at https://etherscan.io/ or https://www.blockchain.com/explorer and see live transactions. Everything is stored in the ledger.

# Uses for Blockchain

* Distributed finance
* Supply chain tracking
* Insurance 
* Fraud and counterfeit authentication
* Idenity managment 

# What are we going to do

* Write a contract in solidity.
* Deploy the contract to a network.
* Use the contract and watch the transactions be stored in the blocks.
